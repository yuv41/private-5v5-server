// You can overwrite any default permissions on any pugsetup command here.
// Allowed permissions are: "all", "captain", "leader", "admin", "none"
// The order of permissions is admin > leader > captain > all.
// This means a command marked "captain" can also be accessed also by the leader and admins.
// Note: when a game isn't using captains, "captain" commands automatically become "all" commands.
